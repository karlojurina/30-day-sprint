# Client tests

No test runner in this repo, and adding one (vitest/jest + a DOM shim) is a
bigger change than the thing being tested. Node 22 strips TypeScript natively,
so these run with no build step and no new dependency:

```bash
node client-tests/build.mjs
node --experimental-strip-types client-tests/watch-heartbeat.test.mjs
```

or `npm run test:client`.

## How it stays honest

`build.mjs` copies the **real** `src/lib/world/watch-heartbeat.ts` and rewrites
its three import lines and nothing else: `@/lib/supabase-browser` and
`@/lib/call-gate` point at local stubs, and `./tella` gains the `.ts` Node
needs. The Supabase stub is wrapped in a three-line counter, so the test can
prove that a heartbeat handed its own `rpc` never builds a client. That
counter is the only code in the generated file that is not in the source.
Everything else is byte-for-byte the shipping source. If the test passed
against a retyped copy it would be testing a fiction.

The other modules under test are copied the same way (`build.mjs` lists them,
with what each one needed rewritten). A copy that still holds an `@/` import
stops the build.

Server code is copied too (since 2026-10-16): the Whop backfill and the visit
route that runs it, the Whop webhook, `mark-action-shipped`, `skip-lesson`,
the CSM's event hooks, and the two routes that write a discount request
(`request` and `submit-feedback`, for a double submit refused by v106's
index, which the stand-in has under its real name). A database function a
route calls through `.rpc()` is a stand-in the test writes itself, from the
migration's body. Their imports go to `_gen/stub-server.ts`, a
hand-written stand-in for Next's response, the service-role Supabase client
(rows in plain arrays, answered the way PostgREST answers where a route depends
on it: `.single()` on no row is an error, a select returns only the columns it
names, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` returns only the rows it added), Whop's
completions read, the steps after a lesson (recorded in order) and the catalog
flags. Each test calls the route's own `POST` with a real `Request`.
`whop-backfill.test.mjs` also checks the login callback's one streak line in
the source; since T-079 `streak.test.mjs` runs the callback itself (below).

Since T-079 (2026-10-17) `streak.test.mjs` runs every route that writes or
shows the streak through its own entry point: `lesson-watched` and the webhook
with the real chain after a lesson (`complete-lesson.ts`), the visit's
backfill, `mark-action-shipped`, the old course's `toggle-lesson`,
`submit-quiz` and `skip-lesson`, the app's data read, and the login callback
itself (`GET`, with Whop's login calls, the password sign-in and the redirect
as stand-ins in `stub-server.ts`, and the real `pkce.ts` signing the state;
its copy leaves out the source's `//` comment lines, because two of them name
a student and a customer's email and this repository is public).
The streak's steps are the one exception to "recorded, never run": the stub
records `updateStudentStreak`, `tickStudentStreak` and `markStudentActive`,
then runs the real `update-streak.ts`, so the suite reads the
`student_streaks` row and `students.last_active_at` each route left. Next's
`after()` is a stand-in too: it keeps the work a route hands it in
`afterTasks`, so a test can let the response go first and then wait for that
work, and `setAfterMissing(true)` makes it throw as Next's does where the
platform has no `waitUntil`. Each of the suite's fixes was broken on purpose
once, and the suite failed every time.

`stub-call-gate.ts` reimplements the real gate's interval logic (minus its
telemetry fetch, which needs a network), so the interaction between the
heartbeat and the gate is genuinely exercised rather than stubbed away.

`Date.now` is monkeypatched so 12 minutes of playback runs in milliseconds, and
`playFor()` simulates a player reporting ~3.7 times a second **and yields to
the event loop between ticks** — without that, in-flight requests never resolve
and the test measures a situation that cannot happen in a browser. 3.7 a second
was the first player's measured rate, and sections 1 to 9 keep it so their
assertions stand as written. Sections 10 to 17 were added for Tella's player,
which reports every 250 ms: they use the steps measured on it at 1x, 2x and
2.5x and hand the heartbeat its own `rpc` and clock (one control in section 16
leaves the `rpc` out on purpose).

## What it caught

Worth recording, because none of it was visible by reading the code:

1. **Forced writes were silently dropped.** A beat requested while another was
   in flight was discarded. The beat most likely to hit that window is the
   forced one on pause or tab-hide — the write whose entire job is recording
   the final position. Now queued.
2. **Queueing them then doubled the write count**, 100 instead of 50 per
   lesson: the ~0.27s of playback that accrues during the in-flight window
   reads as "something changed", so every write immediately drew another. Only
   *forced* beats are queued now; a throttled one that arrives mid-flight is
   dropped, because the next tick is 270ms away and re-checks the throttle.
3. **A refused beat caused a retry storm.** `lastWriteAt` was only moved on an
   accepted write, so a server-side rate-limit refusal left the client's
   throttle satisfied and it retried on the very next tick — roughly a dozen
   calls in the 5 seconds the server was refusing. `lastWriteAt` now moves on
   any completed round trip; the delta stays banked, so nothing is lost.

It also surfaced that the **first timeupdate writes immediately** rather than
15s in. That was accidental, and it is kept on purpose: the player emits no
timeupdate until playback truly starts, so that beat creates the row and stamps
`first_played_at` at the real moment the student pressed play. It costs one
write and makes "did they even start this lesson" answerable for someone who
leaves after ten seconds.

## Limitation, stated plainly

A forced write during `pagehide` is **best-effort**. supabase-js uses `fetch`
without `keepalive`, and a browser may cancel an in-flight request as the page
goes away. The 15s throttle is what actually bounds the loss: a student who
closes the tab loses at most 15 seconds of position, which is the design, not
a bug this can fix.
