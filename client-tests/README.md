# Client tests

No test runner in this repo, and adding one (vitest/jest + a DOM shim) is a
bigger change than the thing being tested. Node 22 strips TypeScript natively,
so these run with no build step and no new dependency:

```bash
node client-tests/build.mjs
node --experimental-strip-types client-tests/watch-heartbeat.test.mjs
```

or `npm run test:client`.

## How it stays honest

`build.mjs` copies the **real** `src/lib/world/watch-heartbeat.ts` and rewrites
its three import lines and nothing else: `@/lib/supabase-browser` and
`@/lib/call-gate` point at local stubs, and `./tella` gains the `.ts` Node
needs. The Supabase stub is wrapped in a three-line counter, so the test can
prove that a heartbeat handed its own `rpc` never builds a client. That
counter is the only code in the generated file that is not in the source.
Everything else is byte-for-byte the shipping source. If the test passed
against a retyped copy it would be testing a fiction.

The other modules under test are copied the same way (`build.mjs` lists them,
with what each one needed rewritten). A copy that still holds an `@/` import
stops the build.

Server code is copied too (since 2026-10-16): the Whop backfill and the visit
route that runs it, the Whop webhook, `mark-action-shipped`, `skip-lesson`,
the CSM's event hooks, and the two routes that write a discount request
(`request` and `submit-feedback`, for a double submit refused by v106's
index, which the stand-in has under its real name). A database function a
route calls through `.rpc()` is a stand-in the test writes itself, from the
migration's body. Their imports go to `_gen/stub-server.ts`, a
hand-written stand-in for Next's response, the service-role Supabase client
(rows in plain arrays, answered the way PostgREST answers where a route depends
on it: `.single()` on no row is an error, a select returns only the columns it
names, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` returns only the rows it added), Whop's
completions read, the steps after a lesson (recorded in order) and the catalog
flags. Each test calls the route's own `POST` with a real `Request`.
`whop-backfill.test.mjs` also checks the login callback's one streak line in
the source; since T-079 `streak.test.mjs` runs the callback itself (below).

Since T-079 (2026-10-17) `streak.test.mjs` runs every route that writes or
shows the streak through its own entry point: `lesson-watched` and the webhook
with the real chain after a lesson (`complete-lesson.ts`), the visit's
backfill, `mark-action-shipped`, the old course's `toggle-lesson`,
`submit-quiz` and `skip-lesson`, the app's data read, and the login callback
itself (`GET`, with Whop's login calls, the password sign-in and the redirect
as stand-ins in `stub-server.ts`, and the real `pkce.ts` signing the state;
its copy leaves out the source's `//` comment lines, because two of them name
a student and a customer's email and this repository is public).
The streak's steps are the one exception to "recorded, never run": the stub
records `updateStudentStreak`, `tickStudentStreak` and `markStudentActive`,
then runs the real `update-streak.ts`, so the suite reads the
`student_streaks` row and `students.last_active_at` each route left. Next's
`after()` is a stand-in too: it keeps the work a route hands it in
`afterTasks`, so a test can let the response go first and then wait for that
work, and `setAfterMissing(true)` makes it throw as Next's does where the
platform has no `waitUntil`. Each of the suite's fixes was broken on purpose
once, and the suite failed every time.

The closed doors before the new course (T-078, 2026-10-17) have two tests.
`student-app-gate.test.mjs` imports `src/lib/student-app-gate.ts` straight
from `src/` (its one import is a type, so there is nothing to rewrite), asks
the rule open, closed, allowlisted and for the team against a small database
that records every read, and reads the source of every route under
`/api/student` and of the team's surfaces. The same file runs on `main`, where
no harness exists. `student-app-gate-routes.test.mjs` runs 8 real student
routes (the data route, lesson-video, lesson-watched, the Whop backfill,
mark-action-shipped, skip-lesson and the two discount writes) through the real
gate's copy: unset, closed, closed with the student listed, closed with
someone else listed. The callback's door is checked in the source;
`streak.test.mjs` runs the callback itself with the app open.

`discount-september.test.mjs` (T-080, 2026-10-17) runs the week of a student
who first paid in early October (from 1 October until the launch; the group
began on 9 September until Lovro moved it on 2026-10-19, hence the name, and a
September payment is now refused there too) through the backfill, the
webhook and the request route on a calendar it
sets itself: `at(iso, fn)` swaps the global `Date` for one whose `new Date()`
and `Date.now()` answer that moment, for the length of `fn`, so the stand-in
database stamps a completion (its `now()` default) and the route judges at the
moment the story needs, on whatever day the suite runs. It drives both ways
the map applies (the questions form's route and the plain request) for a
student who already holds a request from the old dashboard; the form's
database function stands in from v29's body, and the migration harness
(section 26) runs the real one on the same four cases.

`thirty-view.test.mjs` (admin rebuild, work item 2, 2026-10-20) runs the
admin's bulk 30% loader (`src/lib/admin/thirty-data.ts`) and the 30% page's
builder (`thirty-view.ts`) against `loadDiscountReads`, one student at a time,
on the same stand-in database, for every fixture: the reads, the state, the
counts and every verdict must match. For it the stand-in answers the way
PostgREST does where paging depends on it: no select returns more than 1000
rows, `.range()` returns one page after the order, `.order()` called twice
orders by both columns, `failWhen` fails one batch of a bulk read, and
`shuffle` hands rows back in no fixed order wherever a read's order leaves
them open. Two controls the suite writes into `_gen` (a loader whose reads
skip paging, and one whose completions are paged without a unique order) must
fail the same check, and do.

`admin-today-routes.test.mjs` (admin rebuild, work item 3, 2026-10-20; work
item 4 adds Today's routes to it) runs the rebuilt admin's routes through
their own handlers, starting with `GET /api/admin/thirty`. Its login is the
real team check: `build.mjs` copies `src/lib/admin-auth.ts` with Next's
response and the Supabase client pointed at `stub-server.ts`, so the token is
looked up in the stand-in's users and the member in its `team_members` (a
founder, two csm members and a student who can sign in, all made up), and a
call gets the 401, 403 or 200 it would get on Vercel. The route's answer must
equal the loader and the builder run on the same database at the same moment,
read nothing it may not and write nothing, and fail in plain words. Eight
mutations of the copies (a role left out, a failed login or read answered
with a list, the switch's date dropped, the failed read unnamed,
`maxDuration`, a login with no team row let through) each make it fail.

Work item 4 (2026-10-20) added Today to it: `GET /api/admin/today` (who may
read it; the answer equals `buildSupportRows` over `loadTodayData` for the
caller; C3's filters in the query; the Whop tokens never selected; 1,100
extra members past the 1000-row cap all listed; every failed read a 500 in
plain words, a member who can still earn the 30% included) and
`POST`/`DELETE /api/admin/today/mark` (a mark writes one support record and
closes the row's open queue task with the same actor and moment, the actor
from the login and never from the body; Not needed without a reason, an
unknown reason, another student's or a closed task are refused with nothing
written; a double click within 2 minutes answers the first; Undo by the
author within 15 minutes deletes the record and reopens the task, and answers
403, 409 and 404 per entry otherwise, including the database's one-open-task
index refusing a reopening). For it the stand-in learned `.not()`, `.like()`,
`.lt()`, `.lte()`, `.gt()`, head counts, the columns of the tables Today reads,
and v27's one-open-task index on `tasks`, checked on update as well as insert.
Every error sentence a route answers in it is kept; with `ADMIN_ROUTE_ERRORS_OUT`
set to a file path the suite writes them there as JSON, and
`world-tests/admin-pages.mjs` (work item 5) runs it that way and holds each
sentence to the page's words: no em dash, "unlock" or "EcomTalent".
`support-list.test.mjs` runs the builder itself (`src/lib/admin/support-list.ts`)
on made-up members: each of C4's reasons with its words and thresholds, two
reasons on one student, who is never listed, the heartbeat hold, every
cooldown of C5 (and what ends one), the queue's open tasks and their messages,
C14's folded group, the last message (C12), Handled and its Undo window, and
the page's filter and counts (C13). 23 mutations of the builder, the loader
and the two routes each make one of the two suites fail.

`stub-call-gate.ts` reimplements the real gate's interval logic (minus its
telemetry fetch, which needs a network), so the interaction between the
heartbeat and the gate is genuinely exercised rather than stubbed away.

`Date.now` is monkeypatched so 12 minutes of playback runs in milliseconds, and
`playFor()` simulates a player reporting ~3.7 times a second **and yields to
the event loop between ticks** — without that, in-flight requests never resolve
and the test measures a situation that cannot happen in a browser. 3.7 a second
was the first player's measured rate, and sections 1 to 9 keep it so their
assertions stand as written. Sections 10 to 17 were added for Tella's player,
which reports every 250 ms: they use the steps measured on it at 1x, 2x and
2.5x and hand the heartbeat its own `rpc` and clock (one control in section 16
leaves the `rpc` out on purpose).

## What it caught

Worth recording, because none of it was visible by reading the code:

1. **Forced writes were silently dropped.** A beat requested while another was
   in flight was discarded. The beat most likely to hit that window is the
   forced one on pause or tab-hide — the write whose entire job is recording
   the final position. Now queued.
2. **Queueing them then doubled the write count**, 100 instead of 50 per
   lesson: the ~0.27s of playback that accrues during the in-flight window
   reads as "something changed", so every write immediately drew another. Only
   *forced* beats are queued now; a throttled one that arrives mid-flight is
   dropped, because the next tick is 270ms away and re-checks the throttle.
3. **A refused beat caused a retry storm.** `lastWriteAt` was only moved on an
   accepted write, so a server-side rate-limit refusal left the client's
   throttle satisfied and it retried on the very next tick — roughly a dozen
   calls in the 5 seconds the server was refusing. `lastWriteAt` now moves on
   any completed round trip; the delta stays banked, so nothing is lost.

It also surfaced that the **first timeupdate writes immediately** rather than
15s in. That was accidental, and it is kept on purpose: the player emits no
timeupdate until playback truly starts, so that beat creates the row and stamps
`first_played_at` at the real moment the student pressed play. It costs one
write and makes "did they even start this lesson" answerable for someone who
leaves after ten seconds.

## Limitation, stated plainly

A forced write during `pagehide` is **best-effort**. supabase-js uses `fetch`
without `keepalive`, and a browser may cancel an in-flight request as the page
goes away. The 15s throttle is what actually bounds the loss: a student who
closes the tab loses at most 15 seconds of position, which is the design, not
a bug this can fix.
